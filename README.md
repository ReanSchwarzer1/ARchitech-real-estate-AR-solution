<h2 align="center"> The Problem Statement </h2>  
On the onset of the pandemic, a number of fields that prioritized, nay mandated, physical interaction with customers such as the construction and real-estate industry, are crumbling do to the lack thereof. 

It has become a necessity for such work cultures to embrace the world of the virtual and implement strategies that not only tackle the "customer's physical presence is a must" mindset of such industries, but further buttress the previously elucidated advantages of working "virtually".

<h2 align="center"> Idea / Approach </h2>  
To combat such a situation, we have devised an infrastructure platform that has the capacity to support a number of occupations that rely on a more 'hands-on' work ethic.

Using cutting edge Augmented Reality technology powered by AR Cloud Service Echo AR, which allows for the placement and view of real-estate in real-time, the application allows for the collaboration of all fields within the ‘infrastructure’ realm to provide a succinct view of multiple renditions of the house, including the finished, unfinished and an under construction view.
