<h2 align="center"> This project was made in purpose for the Open AR problem statement for the ACM Hacksprint 2.0 hackathon. </h2>  


<h2 align="center"> The Problem Statement </h2>  
On the onset of the pandemic, a number of fields that prioritized, nay mandated, physical interaction with customers such as the construction and real-estate industry, are crumbling do to the lack thereof. 

It has become a necessity for such work cultures to embrace the world of the virtual and implement strategies that not only tackle the "customer's physical presence is a must" mindset of such industries, but further buttress the previously elucidated advantages of working "virtually".

<h2 align="center"> Idea / Approach </h2>  
To combat such a situation, we have devised an infrastructure platform that has the capacity to support a number of occupations that rely on a more 'hands-on' work ethic.

Using cutting edge Augmented Reality technology powered by AR Cloud Service Echo AR, which allows for the placement and view of real-estate in real-time, the application allows for the collaboration of all fields within the ‘infrastructure’ realm to provide a succinct view of multiple renditions of the house, including the finished, unfinished and an under construction view.
<h2 align="center"> Tech Stack </h2>  
<li>Echo AR<br></li>
<li>Unity Engine<br></li>
<li>Blender<br></li>
<li>Unity Engine<br></li>
<li>Android (v7 and above) Device with ARCore support<br></li>

<h2 align="center"> Application of Augmented Reality </h2>  

<li>A real-time Augmented Reality application which renders multiple infrastructural models in worldspace through Android Devices with an ARCore enabled Camera.<br></li> 
<li>AR modules include 1:1 scale interactable and explorable models. These modules can be selected manually by the user through the UI menu.
The modules consist of:<br></li>
Furnished 1:1 scale model of a House with a UI overlay
Empty 1:1 scale model of a House with a UI overlay
1:1 scale model of a House with structural details such as layout and sizes.

<li>Additional echoARbuddy app includes Construction Phases expressed through 3D models created in Blender and rendered through the echoAR console<br></li>
